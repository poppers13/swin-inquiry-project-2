                    Birds from Privacy Sandbox
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After Google decided to end the usage of cookies, privacy sandbox was the alternaive offered to the public to replace them.<br>
                    Even though this was offered as the solution if cookies truely were to disappear. The tests in Europe were postponed due to GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) violation concerns and the initial impressions regarding this technology hasn't been promising. Most being concerned over the technology being too narrow for being the replacement of cookies.<br>
                    However, the path the technology is currently on shows major improvements with more companies joining and providing their own ideas and innovations which has led to the current collection of "birds" such as SPARROW, TURTLEDOVE, DOVEKEY and the PARROT. Each being a tracker, but approched with a differnt integration carrying capabilities and reaches of their own.<br>
                    That said, the technology is still very much in development and quite far away from being the one and only replacement to cookies.
