                        Cookies and sessions are useful when surfing the web, but how exactly do they work? 
                        Firstly, we need to start with protcols. <br/><br/>

                        To transfer data over the Internet we make use of protocols. In particular HTTPS (hyper-text transfer protocol secure), which by default is a <em>stateless</em> protocol.
                        Cookies and sessions are what make HTTPS a <em>stateful</em> protocol. But what does this mean? <br/>

                        Cookies are used for keeping data streamline, matching up with the session that's placed on a server.
                        Websites will ask to accept cookies in order to follow data privacy protection law standards. If you choose to deny 
                        them they won't be used. <br/>

                        However, once you accept a cookie, it will gain access to information such as webiste name, browser ID, browsing 
                        habits, time spent on a webiste and more. <br/>

                <h2>When are Cookies & Sessions Used & Stored?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies and sessions are used all the time when we are accessing the Internet.
                        
                        Where cookies are stored client side and downloaded onto the HDD of a user's computer and handled by the browser, 
                        most sessions are found on web servers, and only a handful being stored on the client side.
                        They are only able to store a maximum of 4KB of data. 
                    </p>

                    <aside>
                        <p>The ID is usually made up of a string of characters much like a cookie! <br>
                        <p>For example: <code id="cookie-id">A9A3BECE0563982D</code></p>
                    </aside>

                    <p>
                        If sessions are to be stored client side, it means the session information will be able to load faster as it won't have to verify against 
                        sessions on the server. <br/>
                        This is often the case when storage required is low, however if more storage space is needed,
                        then the sessions should be stored on the server side.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Who has Access to Cookies & Sessions?</h3>
                        <p>For the most part, cookies can only be accessed by the website which requested the cookie. <br/>
                            However, cookies can make use of a unique ID which allows for servers being able to match up with the cookie data on the server. <br/>
